      <description>This project covers a series of my work, ranging from fundamentals of distributionally robust learning under covariate shift, to its integration to real-world safe exploration and domain adaption tasks.
Distributionally robust learning involves a minimax game between a predictor and an adversary, who is usually subject to constraints from data. Instead of focusing on the robustness against adversarial perturbations on the covariate variables, as in many recent literatures, I focus on using conditional output distributions as adversaries.</description>

      <description>This project is a collaboration between machine learning researchers and social scientists. It is a joint effort by a group of undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, and professors. Meet our team members here! Check our medium posts for further reading here!
We aim to use AI techniques for building a more trustworthy social media. We work on online trolling detection, public discussion monitoring, social network analysis, and so on. Our research asks: what a healthier public communication environment would be like in this era?</description>
