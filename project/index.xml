      <description>This project covers a series of my work, ranging from fundamentals of distributionally robust learning under covariate shift, to its integration to real-world safe exploration and domain adaption tasks.
Distributionally robust learning involves a minimax game between a predictor and an adversary, who is usually subject to constraints from data. Instead of focusing on the robustness against adversarial perturbations on the covariate variables, as in many recent literatures, I focus on using conditional output distributions as adversaries.</description>

      <description>This project covers a series of my work on uncertainty quantification under distribution shift, especially covariate shift. We look at various metrics to evaluate the quality of uncertainty estimates, ranging from marginal coverage, sharpness, to expected calibration errors (for subgroups). We aim to develop rigorous and principled methods that is also practical in real world applications. For example, we try to improve and better balance the sample complexity and computational complexity for popular distributon-free methods like conformal predictions.</description>
