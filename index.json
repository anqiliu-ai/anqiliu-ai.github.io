    "content": "This project is a collaboration between machine learning researchers and social scientists. It is a joint effort by a group of undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, and professors. Meet our team members here!\nWe aim to use AI techniques for building a more trustworthy social media. We work on online trolling detection, public discussion monitoring, social network analysis, and so on. Our research asks: what a healthier public communication environment would be like in this era? And how can machine learning help?\nHere are some featured projects:\n Understanding the prominent #metoo movement: What are people talking about and how are different topics discussed?  \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;* Finding Social Media Trolls: Dynamic Keyword Selection Methods for Rapidly-Evolving Online Debates. In Neurips workshp: AI for Social Good, 2019.\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;* Tracking Social Media Movements with Dynamic Keyword Algorithm. In American Political Science Association Annal Meeting and Exhibition, 2020.\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;* Understanding the Evolution of the #MeToo Movement Over Time Using Topic Models. In ICML WIML Un-Workshop, 2020.\nContributors:Maya Srikanth, Sara Kangaslahti, Nicholas Adams-Cohen, Jian Cao, Jean Kossaifi, Mike Alvarez, and Anima Anandkumar.\n",
